# poncos
Poor Mans Co-Scheduler

Poncos is a simple scheduler that applies co-scheduling of applications based
on the main memory bandwidth utilization.

## Requirements
The source code in this repository is essential self contained and all unusual
dependencies are automatically build when compiling poncos. Nonetheless, you
require:

* A compiler supporting C++14.
* CMake (version >= 3.1)

## Setup
To use poncos you must:

1. first install [mmbwmon](https://github.com/lrr-tum/mmbwmon) on all nodes you plan to use for scheduling.
2. start mmbwmon on all nodes while they are idle. Wait until the initialization phase of mmbwmon is completed.
3. if you are not using a SandyBridge EP system, adjust the file system_config/sandybridge_EP.cpp to match your system (or create a new one and add a new build target to CMake).
4. compile poncos as every other CMake based project.
5. create a machine-file containing all hostnames of the nodes you want to use for your applications. Use linebreaks to seperate the hostnames (i.e. one hostname per line).
6. create a queue file containing one application command line per line (see examples).
7. run the poncos binary with --help and read the options on how to pass the machine-file and queue.
